        <p>It was long after the close of business when Indonesia’s highest-ranking judge stepped out of his official residence in Jakarta to greet some guests, one night in October 2013. It had been a busy few weeks for Akil Mochtar. In his capacity as head of the Constitutional Court, he had been called upon to preside over a flurry of cases brought by candidates who had recently taken part in regional elections. Those who felt they had been cheated out of victory through bribes, vote tampering or any of a number of ruses used to gain an edge in close-fought contests could challenge the result in Akil’s court. </p>

        <p>Akil was working late because he had a lucrative side job. By day he fulfilled his official role, running one of the nation’s most trusted institutions while presenting the face of an impartial judge. By night he peddled his verdicts, negotiating with litigants who sought to buy his decisions for cash. Akil had become a part of the corrupt system he was supposed to police. </p>

        <p>Waiting for Akil, sitting on a bench next to the manicured bushes on his terrace, was a businessman with four envelopes underneath his shirt stuffed with a total of US$250,000 in U.S. and Singapore dollars. He was accompanied by an austere woman wearing a hijab and spectacles, a member of parliament who had brokered the deal about to go down. But as soon as Akil stepped out of his front door, more than a dozen investigators from Indonesia’s anti-corruption agency, the KPK, swarmed around them, arresting all three.</p>

        <p>
  Akil’s arrest showed how this unseemly business had infected the highest court in the land, one established to safeguard the foundations of Indonesia’s democracy. Adjudicating election disputes was only a part of its remit, and it had gained popularity for a series of progressive decisions that demonstrated its integrity and independence. The KPK discovered Akil had made almost US$5 million dollars by allowing candidates from every major region of the country to reverse defeat or uphold victory, perverting both the justice system and democracy in one go. Evidence gathered by the KPK suggested that backroom dealings were routine for both the judge and the politicians who sought to bribe him, as much a part of the cut-and-thrust of an election as a stump speech.
        </p>
        <p>
  While Akil had been the focal point of its investigation, the KPK began working its way through the politicians caught in its net. The first to go down was Hambit Bintih, who had just won a contentious campaign to be reelected head, or bupati, of Gunung Mas, a remote district on the island of Borneo. The businessman who had brought the cash to Akil had done so on Hambit’s behalf, to secure his second term after the losing candidate challenged the result in the Constitutional Court. Within hours of Akil’s arrest, KPK agents arrested Hambit in a luxury suite on the 17th floor of a Jakarta hotel, bringing his freedom and political career to a close.
  </p>

        <p>
  Under the glare of media attention attracted by their role in Akil’s downfall, some details trickled out about the bupati and the businessman. Named Cornelis Nalau Antun, the businessman was reportedly Hambit’s nephew and had served as his campaign finance manager. During the ensuing trial, it emerged that Cornelis had not only delivered the cash to Akil but had also been tasked with sourcing it. After Hambit negotiated the price with the judge, Cornelis had asked two friends from their home province of Central Kalimantan, each described in court as an “entrepreneur,” if he could borrow the money. Each of the men provided the equivalent of US$100,000 in cash. In their testimony, they claimed never to have asked what it was for.
  </p>
        <p>The KPK were too busy following the other leads of bribery out from Akil to push the investigation further. The charges against Hambit were easily proven through a multitude of text messages exposing his negotiations with the judge, while Cornelis had been caught red-handed. The source of the money was attributed to the largesse of two wealthy men willing to help out a friend, no questions asked. Hambit and Cornelis were sentenced to four and three years in prison respectively. Akil was convicted in a separate trial and sent away for life, bringing the episode to a close. But a deeper story remained untold.
        </p>
        <p>
  The Gecko Project and Mongabay picked up the investigation where the prosecutors left off. We traced the source of the money back further, to a series of land deals cut in the 18 months leading up to the election. These deals represented an area of land more than ten times the size of Manhattan, inhabited by thousands of indigenous people and encompassing some of the best rainforest left on Borneo. Our investigation, based on interviews with sources close to the deals, KPK prosecutors, court records and company documents, shows the bribery of Akil Mochtar was neither the beginning nor the end of the malady that afflicted Gunung Mas. It was just the most visible symptom of a system that has evolved to channel resources to private firms and elect politicians who represent them, at the expense of Indonesia’s people.
        </p>

        <p>
        This June, five years on from Akil’s arrest, voters will return to the polls in 115 districts, 39 towns and 17 provinces. Since the start of the year, the KPK has arrested seven candidates for the upcoming regional elections, suspected of taking bribes to finance their campaigns.  They are expecting there to be many more. But the story of Gunung Mas reveals a more complex form of collusion, harder to detect but more insidious than the graft taking down candidates now. Not only is it pumping dirty money into Indonesia’s politics; it is also driving the sell-off of land and resources, and placing the country’s environment and rural people at the mercy of large corporations. In the case of Hambit Bintih, it went entirely unnoticed.

          The night Hambit and Cornelis were arrested, another man from Gunung Mas, named Iswan, was travelling back home from Jakarta. Iswan had campaigned with Hambit’s defeated rival in the recent election for district chief. Earlier that same day, he had sat on the witness stand to be questioned by Akil in a hearing on the election dispute. When he stopped for the night in Palangkaraya, the capital of Central Kalimantan, he learned of the bust via a call from his friends, and then saw it was being covered on national TV. For Iswan, a squat, lively man in his early 40s, the news held special resonance. He had spent the past year locked in a battle with the bupati over the fate of four villages in Gunung Mas, including the one into which he was born.
        </p>

        <p>
        Iswan’s home village of Tuyun sits on the banks of the Kahayan, a majestic river flowing south from the depths of the Bornean rainforest, through Palangkaraya and onwards to the Java Sea.  In 2012, word spread in Tuyun and neighbouring villages that their land was to be annexed by a vast oil palm plantation. The first sign of the plan was the appearance of stakes in their land, placed to delineate the boundaries of the project. Iswan was travelling through when he heard the rumblings of discontent. “It will be the death of us,” he recalled people saying. “It was going to affect everybody.”

          Gunung Mas lies in Central Kalimantan, one of five provinces in Indonesian Borneo. Until recently, the district was dominated by ancient rainforests for which the island is famous, teeming with orangutans, hornbills, clouded leopards, gibbons and many other species at risk of extinction. Several thousand families lived in remote villages clinging to the banks of rivers. In its northernmost reaches begin the mountains that form a spine through the centre of the island. In the northern foothills lies the site of a historic gathering where some 300 chiefs from across the island, in 1894, agreed to peace among themselves and with the Dutch colonialists. The meeting kindled a sense of shared identity among the linguistically and culturally diverse peoples of Borneo’s interior, under the umbrella name ‘Dayak’.
        </p>

        <img src="images/dayak.jpg" alt="Mountain View">

        <p>
          If the 20th century began for the Dayaks with an uneasy truce with the Dutch, it would be defined by an increasingly exploitative relationship with outsiders who sought their resources. The villagers of Gunung Mas made a living through subsistence farming, cultivating fruit trees and rice, tapping rubber and extracting gold from rivers. Like most of Indonesia’s indigenous peoples, they governed their territory through unwritten custom. Land belonged collectively to the community, and to past and future generations. The current inhabitants were stewards, who could lend the land to outsiders but never sell it in perpetuity. </p>

        <p>These customary rules were recognised in Indonesia’s 1945 constitution. But they conflicted with a litany of subsequent state laws aimed at increasing the government’s control over resources. From the mid-1960s, the nation was in the grips of a military dictator named Suharto, who used these laws to grant logging licenses to his family and cronies. Under Suharto, Gunung Mas was targeted relentlessly by firms connected to the elite. Resistance, as the Dayak forests were increasingly degraded, was stifled by fear of the ruthless regime.</p>

        <section class="content">

          <p>
  In the early 2000s, after Suharto finally fell, control over land was shifted from Jakarta to district governments headed by bupatis. At the same time, global demand was growing for palm oil, an edible oil used in the food industry, cosmetics and biofuels. Borneo provided perfect conditions for the crop. The newly empowered bupatis were soon courted by wealthy plantation firms, mainly from Indonesia and neighbouring Malaysia, that coveted land on which to expand. Within their first terms in office, between 2003 and 2008, the bupatis ceded millions of hectares to plantation firms, much of it already claimed by indigenous communities.
          </p>

          <p>
  It soon became clear that the bupatis, wielding similar levels of control over their districts that Suharto had over the nation, were highly susceptible to the allure of corruption. Dozens fell prey to busts by the KPK, principally for taking bribes. But the circumstances under which they had granted huge swaths of the country to private investors went largely unscrutinised.

                Hambit Bintih’s journey to becoming the bupati of Gunung Mas began when he escaped the hardships of a life in the forest for the privilege of an education in Palangkaraya. He was born in 1958, into a family of farmers in a village named Tumbang Kajuei. Even today, few from Gunung Mas go beyond a secondary school education; Hambit attended university, then joined the civil service. By the time the Suharto dictatorship collapsed in 1998, he had risen to become head of the tax collection agency in the provincial capital. He was an active member of Golkar, the party that had served as Suharto’s electoral vehicle and that would continue to dominate political life in the democratic era.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                Hambit’s bureaucratic and political experience positioned him to play a prominent role in his home district. He was selected to serve as vice bupati, in 2003, deputy to an older man named Julius Djudae Anom. The pair took control of a district with barely any infrastructure, little in the way of an economy and a population that had rankled against the iniquities of the Suharto regime. Yet it remained rich in resources: timber, coal, gold and land.

                        <p>
                Under Djudae, oil palm expansion was muted, even as plantations began to multiply in the coastal districts south of Gunung Mas. But Hartalib Saleh, a member of Djudae’s reelection campaign team, told us Hambit had been lobbying to allow in more private companies. In 2008 Hambit switched parties to run against Djudae, and narrowly won. Now, the fate of the district was in his hands.

                        <p>
                          By the time the mysterious stakes appeared in Iswan’s home village of Tuyun, in 2012, the fate that befell Indonesians whose land was ceded to plantation firms was well known. Some companies took their land without compensation, suppressing resistance with the help of the police and military. Others promised to provide good jobs and smallholdings, promises that went unfulfilled. Rural citizens found no opportunity for recourse, as the state apparatus was mobilised in service of the private sector. Conflicts were now erupting across the country, pitting communities against companies, the state and each other. Iswan, who had watched a particularly violent dispute on the island of Sumatra unfold on TV, was inspired to launch his own opposition.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          After some 300 people from Tuyun and surrounding villages wrote a letter to Hambit objecting to the license that threatened their land, the bupati instructed his deputy, Arton Dohong, to hold a town hall meeting in a schoolhouse near the Kahayan River. The villagers prepared for the event by draping banners across the fronts of their homes. One, for which Iswan took personal credit, depicted children and asked, “What will our grandchildren eat?” “It was very, very affecting for the community,” he said.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          Arton arrived at the schoolhouse, where some 150 residents had gathered, with a platoon of police officers. He listened as the people expressed their concerns. But, he told them, the plantation was a government program: it could not be opposed. Then Iswan got a text from one of his coordinators: the police had torn down the banners. “Well, after hearing that, I felt like my blood was trembling,” he recounted.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          The meeting descended into shouting, as Iswan took umbrage with what he saw as a suppression of the freedom of speech. It broke down without an agreement. But Iswan pledged that if Hambit’s administration did not excise the villages from the plantation, he would stage a mass protest. As Hambit stalled, the villagers soon descended on a local government office. YouTube footage shows them amassed in front of officials and a line of police, as a spokesperson voices their demands through a loudspeaker.

                            Tuyun was not the only site of unrest in Gunung Mas that year. Further northwest, in the subdistricts of North Kahayan Hulu and Teweh, nine villages discovered plans for another giant plantation, one that would wedge them into just a single kilometer between it and the Kahayan River. Hundreds more Dayaks amassed outside the district parliament, demanding that the license be revoked.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            On the face of it, the communities won their battles. In Tuyun, the company promised in writing not to strongarm them into selling their farms. In the northwest, Hambit declared their land should be excised from the concession. But as he was publicly entertaining their demands, the bupati issued a separate spate of licenses in secret. These new licenses would affect the very same villages that were right then vigorously opposing plantations, but far more deeply.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            Where the first concession in Tuyun began three kilometres from the villages, but in their farmland, a second one swallowed all of their land and the villages themselves. In all, six new licenses, handed out in the last 18 months of Hambit’s term in office, threatened to subsume dozens of villages strung along the Kahayan River and its tributary the Rungan. If developed, they would leave thousands of residents with just a few hundred meters of farmland between their homes the start of the oil palm trees.

                                <p>
  Under Hambit, the business of government was carried out in a series of high-end hotels and restaurants in Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, 1,000 kilometres from Gunung Mas. There he would deal personally with investors who sought land in Gunung Mas. In Indonesia’s palm oil boom, district bureaucracies played a cursory role, doing the bidding of bupatis like Hambit who could wield their enormous powers unilaterally.
  </p>
                                <p>
  Those who earned an audience with Hambit first had to pass through a man who acted as his fixer in Jakarta. On condition of anonymity, he spoke to us one evening in the lobby of a hotel. Hambit, he said, had wanted to deal with genuine investors, but had been deluged with “brokers” who only wanted permits in order to sell them to someone else. It was the fixer’s job to screen them out. He would meet them first, before arranging credible investors to see the bupati.                               </p>

                                <p>
  The fixer described Hambit as a gregarious and humble man. The two had travelled to Germany together during Hambit’s first term, where the bupati had been inspired by the well-paved roads and wind turbines. “His motivation was to make Gunung Mas famous,” the fixer said. “He wanted a better life for Gunung Mas, but it wasn’t easy.”
  </p>
                                <p>
  Though he praised Hambit’s character, the fixer was candid about the system in which he operated. Even genuine investors would make under-the-table payments for the privilege of obtaining a license. The fixer referred to it as a “cycle of evil” between government and investors. But he insisted that Hambit had made little profit through this means, as it was swallowed up in other ways. “They say the ghost eats the devil’s money,” he explained using a common proverb. “It means money obtained illegally will be taken by others.”

    <p> Soliciting bribes in exchange for issuing licenses was a straightforward way for bupatis to make money. But it was also a good way to get arrested by the KPK. Intercepting politicians in the act of receiving cash payments, often through wiretaps and sting operations, was the agency’s bread and butter. This was brought into relief in mid-2012, when a bupati from the island of Sulawesi, Amran Batalipu, was caught soliciting 3 billion rupiah (US$300,000) from a businesswoman in return for granting her company an oil palm plantation license. Amran’s undoing was a KPK wiretap. He was jailed for seven and a half years.</p>

    <p> But some bupatis quickly learned they could make far more money in a way that fell outside the glare of the KPK. Operating without oversight, the bupatis could issue licenses to shell companies set up by their cronies or relatives. Even with just an initial permit, the value of a shell company — existing only on paper, perhaps registered to a residential address — could rocket from zero to millions of dollars. The cronies or relatives, in turn, could sell the company on to a major plantation company. Yadyn Amin, a KPK prosecutor, told us it would be “suicide” for a bupati to register such a company in his or her own name. But if the listed owner was someone they could control, the bupati could effectively hold shares off the books. “They can be like a shadow,” he said.
  </p>

  <p>
    The process provided the corruption — a bupati marshalling state assets for his or her own benefit — with a veneer of legality. It was not inherently illegal to give permits to a family member. Indonesia’s corruption law demanded more: that the licensing process break some other regulation, and that the state incur losses as a result. A suitcase full of cash might take a bupati down. But a wire transfer of millions, via a family member, was clean.
  </p>

  <p>
    Jeffrey Winters, a Northwestern University professor who studies oligarchy in Indonesia and elsewhere, told us the “narrow” definition of corruption in Indonesian law creates vast grey areas. “There are thousands of examples like this that are clearly acts of corruption by any global standard, but which Indonesian power-players have managed to isolate in a murky zone of 'odious but not necessarily illegal’,” he wrote in an email. “This leaves a huge part of the Indonesian patronage game intact and difficult to prosecute. It also means that officials spend a great deal of their time and talent scheming about ways to be wildly corrupt but avoid the specific Indonesian definition of corruption.”
  </p>

  <p>
  We interviewed staff involved in acquisitions at one of the world’s largest palm oil firms, and due diligence lawyers from Indonesia and Malaysia. All of them confirmed that buying assets from someone connected closely to a bupati, even a family member, would present no legal risk. That they might be channelling millions of dollars to corrupt politicians was not a concern. Anangga W. Roosdiono, founder of Roosdiono & Partners, which carries out due diligence for plantation firms, went further. He suggested it would be an advantage. “As long as I know the deal will stay quiet, I will do the deal,” he told us at his office in Jakarta, taking the voice of a prospective buyer. “Because if I know that the bupati is behind this, as long as he is there my whole business will be safe.” Anangga had advised his clients not to do such deals. “But some of our clients still insist,” he said.

  <p>
  In Gunung Mas, millions of dollars from such deals went to the man who would later bribe Akil Mochtar on Hambit’s behalf: Cornelis Nalau Antun.

  <section class="content cornelis">


      <h2>Cornelis Nalau Antun</h2>


      <p>
  Cornelis was born in 1973, in a village not far from Hambit’s own. He too had left the interior of Borneo, eventually going to work for mining companies in Jakarta. Television coverage of his trial showed a round-faced man with glasses and a receding hairline. He looked like the manager of a corporate office accidentally parachuted into a major graft case, with a fleshy build that spoke to a life lived away from the forest. By the time the deals went down in Gunung Mas, his home was a lime-green mansion in Palangkaraya, incongruously squeezed behind squat concrete dwellings in a dusty, unpaved corner of the town. </p>

  <p>After the arrest, Arton, the deputy bupati, told reporters in Jakarta that Cornelis was Hambit’s nephew. During his trial, Cornelis testified that he and Hambit had grown close after 2007, when he joined the campaign team for Hambit’s first election. Hambit referred to him affectionately as “Lis,” and the younger man had been at his side through the most critical moments of his political career, performing some of the riskiest roles.
  </p>


      <p>
  During the corruption trial, Cornelis told the court he had agreed to bribe Akil out of respect for Hambit. But he also said they had formed a pact: Before the end of Hambit’s second term, in the middle of 2018, the outgoing bupati would anoint Cornelis his successor. The payoff was dependent on Hambit winning reelection and consolidating his power, which in turn relied on a flow of money to the campaign. Their bond would course through politics and business, and into the blurred space between the two.
      </p>

      <p>
  At some point, likely midway through Hambit’s first term, he and Cornelis established a plan to exploit the bupati’s control of land, using the kind of scheme that would fly beneath the radar of Indonesia’s enforcement agencies. Two sources — Hambit’s fixer, and another man close to the people involved in the deals — told us the idea came from Hambit, who instructed his protégé to set up shell companies that would serve as vehicles for selling licenses. “Hambit saw the opportunity,” the fixer said. “He asked Cornelis, ‘make the company with your name and do it’.” Once that was done, according to the second source, Cornelis “knew the permits would be sorted. It was done quickly.”
      </p>

      <p>In 2011, Cornelis formed a partnership with two other men who could provide the skills, experience and contacts he lacked. Elan Gahu, a Dayak from the east of the province, had already served as co-founder and director of a shell company formed in Gunung Mas in 2009. Within a year, it had obtained a license from Hambit and been sold to a Malaysian firm for US$4.6 million. It was precisely the kind of deal Cornelis sought to replicate. An old friend of Elan’s named Edwin Permana, with whom he shared roots in a district east of Gunung Mas, was brought on as the third partner. Edwin had worked as a land-clearing contractor for oil palm firms in West and Central Kalimantan. He would provide the partners with a connection to another Malaysian firm, CB Industrial Products, cash-rich and hungry for land.

                                  <p> CB Industrial Products, or CBIP, had made its first foray into Indonesia’s plantation sector in 2009, two years before Cornelis and his partners came together. It bought a shell company, registered in the British Virgin Islands, with a license for 8,000 hectares of forest in Lamandau, a hilly district 170 kilometres west of Gunung Mas. Very quickly it ran into legal trouble.
                                    .</p>

                                  <p>
  CBIP was formed in 1980 as an engineering firm, and its core business remained the production of equipment for palm oil factories. Its chairman, Yusof Basiron, is a prominent figure in Malaysian palm oil. He sat on the board of Sime Darby, a multibillion-dollar company part-owned by the Malaysian government. He was also CEO of the Malaysian Palm Oil Council, a state-funded body dedicated to promoting the commodity to the world. It did so in part by brazenly denying the industry’s well-documented role in a litany of social and environmental abuses, including the theft of indigenous lands and the destruction of forests and peat swamps, a key driver of climate change. In a 2010 presentation to industry representatives that was typical of the form, Basiron characterized NGO campaigners highlighting the role of palm oil firms in deforestation as “paid agents” of “EU trade protectionists”.

                                <p>
  Over time, CBIP had gravitated towards the lucrative business of developing plantations, first in Malaysian Borneo and later in Indonesia. Soon after acquiring the Lamandau concession, the firm sparked a conflict with Dayaks in the village of Cuhai. The village chief, a diminutive, razor-sharp man in his mid-30s named Darius Pilos Pagi, investigated CBIP’s subsidiary, unearthing evidence he claimed proved it had begun clearing forest without all of the required permits. In 2010, following a request from the Lamandau parliament, the police looked into the case. But their inquiry went nowhere. As the chief continued his own investigation, he found further evidence suggesting why.
  </p>
                                <p>
  Darius obtained documents from a confidential source within the company, suggesting that Iwan Setia Putra, the CBIP subsidiary’s general manager, had sought to bribe the police to kill the investigation. The documents, seen by The Gecko Project and Mongabay, include an internal memo from Putra requesting 400 million rupiah (US$45,000) to “solve the problem” with the police. Bank documents confirm the money was subsequently transferred to him. Two weeks later, the police mothballed the investigation. (Putra declined to answer questions relating to this payment. CBIP did not respond to several requests for an interview, and declined to answer a list of detailed questions).

                                    <p>
  In a letter sent later to enforcement agencies in Jakarta, including the KPK, Darius wrote that CBIP had made his people “beggars in our own home”. He argued there was evidence of a “conspiracy” between CBIP and the Lamandau police. But the findings from Darius’ investigation sank without a trace. CBIP suffered no tangible consequences from its brush with the law, and went out in search of yet more land to add to its portfolio.

                                    <p>
  In early 2011, after CBIP’s legal troubles died down, Edwin Permana began working for CBIP in Lamandau, a contractor with the firm told us. At the same time, Cornelis and Hambit’s scheme in Gunung Mas was germinating. Elan Gahu, Edwin’s old friend with a track record in Gunung Mas, would bring the trio together. Soon, CBIP would be drawn into a far bigger scandal.

      <p>
  By 2012, all the pieces were in place. Cornelis and his partners had set up the shell companies, Hambit was ready to issue the licenses and CBIP was prepared to buy them. The partners drew clear roles. Elan would handle administrative duties. Edwin would oversee the logistics of clearing dense rainforests. Cornelis would deal with their political patron. </p>

      <p>
  Over the course of nine months in 2012, the year before the election, Cornelis and his partners sold four shell companies to CBIP. The licenses covered almost 60,000 hectares, more than enough to make them the largest landowners in the district. The concessions overlapped with Tuyun and other villages that were trying to keep plantations at bay, and dozens more. The deals were structured so that the full amount was only payable to Cornelis and his partners once the companies had advanced through the permitting process. But as soon as the deals with CBIP were signed, Hambit pushed them through quickly.

                                    <p>
  Done properly, the permitting process can take years. For these companies, Hambit made sure it took a matter of weeks. To do so he had to ignore the fact that environmental impact assessments had not been carried out. That decision ensured the affected villagers did not know about the projects for months more and rendered the process illegal. But it also ensured more money flowed before the election.                              </p>

                                    <p>
  By the time the deals were all completed, Cornelis and his partners would make US$9.2 million, simply by shuffling papers between Hambit and CBIP. But they also each retained a small percentage in the shell companies. As paper licenses were transformed into real, sprawling plantations, they would make much more. Within a few years, once the land was all planted, Cornelis’ slim share alone could be worth almost US$20 million.
  </p>

  <p>
  The partners were proud of their success. They became a tight-knit group, drinking beer outside one another’s homes on balmy nights in Palangkaraya. But they remained bound to the bupati who was responsible for their swiftly changed circumstances. And for Hambit, their job was not over.</p>

  As the 2013 election approached, Iswan, who had spurred the protests against Hambit’s permits the year before, was invited to the large, modern home of a young businessman named Jaya Samaya Monong. After some small talk, Jaya told Iswan he planned to enter the race for bupati of Gunung Mas. With a large oil palm estate of his own, and a cousin who was the governor of the province, Jaya had both the resources and the connections to mount a credible challenge to the incumbent.
                                                                      <p>
  Jaya asked Iswan to join his “success team”, the sprawling network of volunteers who would help wage the campaign. Iswan could offer Jaya the glow of association with a grassroots activist and proven organizing skills. In return for his support, Iswan asked that Jaya, should he win, issue no more plantation licenses, and revoke existing ones held by the “naughty companies” imposing their will on Dayak villagers. “These are what we call political commitments,” Iswan recalled Jaya telling him. “Good! I accept the offer.”

      <p>
        But the election would not be fought on the basis of such commitments. By 2013, it was an open secret that campaigns were less a battleground of policy than a competition over who could spend the most money.
      <p>
  The term “money politics” has come to be used in Indonesia as a catchall for the wide range of dark arts candidates employ to swing elections. This phenomenon is laid out in a forthcoming book by the social scientists Ward Berenschot and Edward Aspinall, entitled Democracy for Sale, in which they describe the “netherworld” of corruption and influence-trading that underpins these contests.
  </p>
  <p>
  Once on the ticket, enlisting the help of local power brokers – imams and priests, village chiefs and clan leaders, the heads of paramilitary groups and sports clubs – is key to galvanising voters. These power brokers expect to receive something in return for their support. But a candidate must also grease the voters themselves. Some of the methods used are legal. They stage concerts featuring famous pop singers, the most popular of whom charge tens of thousands of dollars to perform on the campaign trail. Other methods are prohibited, but both ubiquitous and hugely expensive. </p>
  <p>
  On election day, the success team distributes cash among voters in an illegal practice known as the “dawn attack.” The aim is not to win hearts and minds. The perception is rather that candidates who fail to pay will not be viewed as credible. “You have to do it,” said Alfridel Jinu, a former journalist who was barred from running in the 2013 election on a technicality. “In Gunung Mas, it’s ‘no money, no vote’.”
  </p>

  <section class="content">

      <p>
  The cumulative costs of these methods are enormous, easily running into several million dollars for a district. Many hopefuls stake their own fortunes on their chances for victory, or go deep into debt, risking personal ruin. Hospitals set aside extra beds after elections for those overcome by the psychological impact of a failed bid. But few candidates are able to bear the cost alone. Most are driven to forge alliances with wealthy backers. Challengers can promise future access to government contracts or permits, if they win. Incumbents can fill the coffers in advance, trading on their power while in office. Whoever wins takes office with debts to pay, or already in hock to the private sector.
  </p>
  <p>
  Some politicians have broken the cycle, turning their back on the need to solicit or spend dark money. They have sought to attract voters through popular policies instead, often explicitly standing on anti-graft platforms. As Berenschot and Aspinall observe, such candidates have found success in urban areas with an educated middle class, an active media and a diversified economy. It is far more difficult to run an honest campaign in places where the economy is concentrated in one industry, such as palm oil or mining, which can adopt an outsized influence over the political scene. In such places the “embrace between business and politics is most intense,” shaping the emergence of what the authors call “mafia coalitions.”
  </p>
  <p>
  In Hambit’s case, an entrepreneur now connected to the palm oil industry stood at the heart of his success team. He appointed Cornelis, who now sat atop a fortune in the wake of the CBIP deals, as his campaign treasurer. Their spending power was visible for all to see. They flew Mulan Jameela, a member of one of Indonesia’s best-known musical duos, to Gunung Mas for a concert. They marshaled the backing of seven political parties. But the full extent of their spending prowess would not emerge until after the votes were counted.</p>

        <p>
  The election took place on September 4, 2013. A week later Hambit was declared the winner, with a shade over half the vote. Jaya, languishing in second place with 39 percent, announced he would challenge the result at the Constitutional Court. His lawsuit, filed later that month, described “fraud that was structured, massive, systematic and very influential” on the part of Hambit’s campaign.
    </p>
    <p>
  Hambit’s success team was alleged to have offered voters up to 300,000 rupiah (US$22) for each ballot cast in his favour. In a district with some 60,000 voters, such largesse could have cost him more than US$1 million. He was also accused of abusing his power over the state apparatus to secure his victory. Jaya claimed that voter cards had not been distributed to all villages, that hundreds of fictional voters had been created, that hundreds of legitimate voters had been expunged from the rolls, and that the organizing committee had handed out additional ballots so that their supporters could vote more than once.
    </p>
    <p>
  Even before the vote, Hambit was approached by an acquaintance offering a connection to Akil Mochtar in the event of a legal challenge to the election, which would would place the decision over the result in the judge’s hands. That year had already seen dozens of election disputes and a small coterie of individuals, it would later emerge, were peddling access to Akil. Hambit eventually got to him via Chairun Nisa, a national lawmaker whose austere appearance and advocacy for religious interests belied her role in the coming scandal.
  </p>
  <p>
    The records from Hambit and Cornelis’ corruption trial would reveal how democracy was casually traded in the month between election day and the sting outside Akil’s house. The negotiations between Hambit and Akil, with Chairun Nisa as the judge’s proxy, took place in five-star hotels and via text message, with U.S. dollars referred to as “Washington apples”. Akil’s misplaced sense of immunity to justice was clear when he received Hambit at his official residence, as their corrupt flirtation began. According to Hambit’s testimony, the judge had reassured him that the use of money in politics was normal, and had quipped he had met a mayor just the day before for the same purpose.
  </p>
  <p>
  The talks culminated in a meeting between Chairun Nisa and Hambit in a lounge on the 18th floor of the luxury Hotel Borobudur in Jakarta. Nisa was joined by her husband, Hambit by Cornelis. As they talked, Nisa fired off texts to the judge conveying Hambit’s attempts to lower the price. It was eventually set at 3 billion rupiah, or US$260,000, payable in U.S. and Singapore dollars. Nisa showed Hambit her final text from Akil. “It’s a fixed price,” it read. “No reductions.” Hambit turned to his campaign treasurer. “Do we have the money, Lis?”</p>
  <p>
  “I will work on it, uncle,” Cornelis replied.
  </p>
  <p>
  Cornelis went straight to his partners in the CBIP deals: Edwin and Elan. Four days after the meeting in the Jakarta hotel, Elan was playing badminton outside Cornelis’ house in Palangkaraya when his host asked to “borrow” the equivalent of US$100,000. Elan rushed the money to him within a day. Edwin, who was then on the resort island of Bali, received the same request via phone and arranged for a mutual acquaintance to deliver the money to his partner.
  </p>
  <p>
  Edwin and Elan would later plead ignorance, each claiming during the trial they had neither known nor asked why their partner needed a fortune, in cash, within a day. “He often borrowed and I never had a problem because it was always returned,” Elan testified. “Nor did I ask for a receipt because of the trust and friendship between us as entrepreneurs”.</p>

  <section class="doc1 image_bg">

  <section class="content">

      <p>
        The KPK prosecutors were sceptical of the notion that the money had been given as a loan, rather than as part of some reciprocal transaction. “No one would provide that kind of money free of charge,” senior prosecutor Pulung Rinandoro, who worked on the case, told us in an interview at KPK headquarters this February. “They must have had a personal interest.” If it had been determined that the money was a payoff, and not a loan, it could have taken the KPK further, asking what Edwin and Elan had got in return. That, in turn, could have led to the licenses and brought the vast plantations now in the hands of CBIP into its scope. The expedited permits, Cornelis’s connection to Hambit and his role in the deals, would have raised further red flags.
  </p>
  <p>
    But the source of the cash, Pulung said, was beyond the scope of the bribery investigation. The agency already had enough evidence to convict Akil, their main target, as well as Hambit and Cornelis; meanwhile its hands were full trying to determine how many other politicians had bribed the judge. There was neither the time nor an obvious reason to press deeper into Gunung Mas. The trail ended with Edwin and Elan, the land deals remained undiscovered, and CBIP’s assets remained intact.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the end, Hambit and Cornelis received a lenient verdict. Though the evidence of bribery was irrefutable, the court treated Hambit as Akil’s victim, a legitimate winner who had been extorted by the judge. Cornelis was presented as an unwitting dupe, drawn astray through loyalty to his mentor. Hambit got four years imprisonment, Cornelis three, in each case less than the prosecutors requested. A mitigating factor, the court decided, was that the bupati had shown “considerable merit” in bringing development to his district.
  </p>
  <p>
    Looking back on 2013, in his introduction to CBIP’s annual report, chairman Yusof Basiran described it as “a stellar year”.

            One bright, clear day in early 2017, we met a Dayak in his mid-30s named Kusmawanson, as he returned to his village, Tumbang Ma-rikoi, in Gunung Mas. He had spent the morning in the forest, tending to fruit trees planted by his ancestors. Kusmawanson was in low spirits. A troop of monkeys had gorged on his fruit. Such incidents were becoming more frequent, as wildlife fled from the forest being cleared for palm oil.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tumbang Marikoi was among the nine villages in the northwest of the district that had protested against one of Hambit’s first plantation licenses, issued in 2010. Elan Gahu, Cornelis’ business partner, had acted as a broker in that deal, helping set up the shell company that acquired the licence before selling it on to another Malaysian firm, in a precursor to the CBIP deals.
      </p>
      <p>
        To quell the opposition, Hambit had issued a decree instructing the company to remove customary land from the license. He prohibited the company from buying land from the villagers without the permission of the district government. The following year the provincial governor instructed the company to aid the process by mapping out the villagers’ customary land.
      </p>
      <p>
        The instructions were effectively ignored. Customary land remained inside the license, and the company only mapped the claims of individuals who agreed to sell land. The complexities of communal land ownership and decision-making were cast aside. Lands owned by the whole community were instead diced up and sold off for the benefit of whoever made the first claim, using maps and contracts drafted by the company. A customary leader told us he was offered a bribe to certify false claims. Villagers who continued to oppose the plantation told us that their forest farms went unmapped, leaving them vulnerable to others who sought to sell it.
      </p>
      <p>
        A young woman named Erma Rusmini told us that one day in 2016, she went to tend the plot of rubber trees, in the forests around Tumbang Marikoi, to find it had been destroyed. Another villager had staked a false claim and sold it to the company. Erma’s family had earned a decent living from tapping rubber. With that income now gone, she and her husband had resorted to selling rice at the local schoolhouse, and the uncertain business of extracting gold from rivers. “Maybe we would have sold it eventually, after our children had finished school or if we didn’t have any choice,” she told us. “But that rubber plot was our only treasure.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Few community members, Kusmawanson told us, sought work with the company because the day rate of 80,000 rupiah, about US$6, was too little to buy food and put their children through school. The jobs were largely filled by landless, impoverished migrants from other islands. But the Dayaks’ own access to land, on which they could grow food or cash crops, was increasingly restricted by the plantation. “We can’t go there because it belongs to the company now,” Kusmawanson said. “We’re facing poverty.”

    The same process had begun in the villages targeted by CBIP. When Kardie, a stoic man in his early 40s, was chosen to lead a village named Pajagei in 2016, he discovered most of its land had been quietly carved up and sold to the Malaysian firm. The deals had been cut by individuals, signed off by his predecessor. It took him by surprise because just one year earlier, in a meeting with the company, the community had rejected the proposed plantation . Many feared it would pollute their supply of clean water and were suspicious of the ambiguity surrounding the benefits promised to them.
  </p>
  <p>
    By 2017, the forest and farms around Pajagei were largely gone, replaced by a denuded yellow landscape pockmarked with young oil palms. The earlier fears proved to be well-founded. Kardie took us on a tour of the streams that flowed into his village. One, he said, used to be so clear that people would travel from surrounding villages to bathe in it. Now it was stagnant and yellow-brown, silted by mud unleashed when the forest was felled.

            Those whose land fell within CBIP’s licenses were offered as little as 5 million rupiah (US$365) per hectare, a pittance for a plot that could feed a family. Mariyadi, a local priest who investigated the deals, described the prices as “murder”. “They’re being duped,” he told us. “The bupati knows, the head of the subdistrict know. But where are their voices? Why are the people being duped?”
      </p>
      <p>
        In village after village where Hambit’s licenses crashed into customary land claims, the same thing had occurred. Resistance to plantations was quickly eroded. “Almost all of them are opposed,” said Yanedi Jagau, a Dayak from Gunung Mas who directs an NGO that helped augment the farmers’ income through tree-planting programmes. “But they can’t speak loudly because there’s no institutions there that are strong enough. It doesn’t mean they agree. Maybe it’s more like anarchy.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The cumulative effect was a wholesale transition of indigenous territory to private companies. If the licenses remain in place, the people of Gunung Mas will lose their rights to the land for at least 35 years, the lifespan of a plantation license. In that time, the district will be radically transformed. The vestiges of Dayak livelihoods and the last lowland rainforests in Gunung Mas will disappear. In return, the farmers will receive perhaps a few hundred dollars each, and the uncertain hope that some of the vast wealth generated for the owners of the plantations will trickle down.
      </p>
      <p>
        Six years on from the issuance of the licenses, this process is still just beginning. Much of the forest has yet to be cleared. But satellite images reveal that CBIP is now penetrating the most northerly lowland forests in the province, including the foothills where the 1894 meeting of Dayak leaders took place. Iswan’s home village of Tuyun is still awaiting the arrival of the bulldozers. In 2016, CBIP sold a majority stake in three of the companies it bought from Cornelis and his partners, including the one that threatens Tuyun, to a businessman from South Kalimantan named Andi Syamsuddin Arsyad.

  Known as Haji Isam, he rose from motorcycle taxi driver to coal magnate. Tempo, Indonesia’s leading investigative media outlet, has repeatedly covered his links to the police and the frequency with which his business rivals are jailed, their assets reassigned to Isam. In 2004, a villager who [protested against his operations] was hacked to death with a machete. Tempo obtained evidence, in the form of written testimony later recanted by the murderer, that Haji Isam had given the order for the attack. In a 2010 interview Haji Isam denied involvement. The magazine reported that in his home district, Isam is regarded as “untouchable”.  </p>

      The fate of thousands of villagers now lies in his hands. The villagers of Tuyun knew nothing of the way their land had been traded. The only clue was a new set of stakes that, like before, appeared to mark out the boundaries of an estate.

      The Akil Mochtar scandal failed to suppress the illicit influence of money in Indonesian elections. Informed observers suggested that the 2014 legislative elections, which took place between his arrest and conviction, were the worst yet. A coordinator for Indonesia Corruption Watch, an NGO that monitored contests across the country, described them as “brutal and chaotic” and said the scale of fraud had increased fourfold since 2009.
    </p>

    <p>
      “In the weeks that followed the poll,” write the editors of the 2016 book Electoral Dynamics in Indonesia: Money Politics, Patronage and Clientelism at the Grassroots, “the consensus view that developed in the media was that candidates had distributed cash payments to voters, handed out goods, and bribed...officials at levels that had never previously been seen in Indonesia’s electoral history.” One renowned politician who lost bemoaned the fact that he had not paid voters.
  </p>
  <p>
    A study released earlier this year by the KPK emphasised the other side of the coin: the corruptive influence of the source of the money. The anti-graft agency interviewed 450 out of almost 800 candidates and their running mates who took part in the 2015 regional elections. Two thirds reported that donors who financed their campaigns wanted something in return: government contracts, jobs, policy influence and, above all, business licenses. “Something awkward happens in every political cycle,” Jimly Asshidique, the founder judge of the Constitutional Court, who chaired the body overseeing elections until 2017, told us in an interview in the restaurant of a Jakarta hotel. “They always try to issue more licenses in the election period.”
  </p>
  <p>
    The practice of mass vote-buying has its roots in a shift in Indonesia’s electoral system that took place in 2005. Before this point, regional leaders were selected by local legislatures, but in 2005 the decision was passed to voters. Where candidates had previously bought the endorsements of the political elites holding parliament seats, they now shifted their attention, and money, to the populace. Candidates in the 2014 elections, interviewed for Electoral Dynamics, consistently pointed to the first election for a bupati, mayor or governor in their region, after 2005, as the point at which “mass vote buying had become part of the local political repertoire”.

    The same year, the bupatis collectively embarked on a massive plantation licensing spree. After 2005, the rate of plantation expansion in Kalimantan increased almost fourfold, to more than 375,000 hectares each year. The bupatis were granted control over licensing in 2003. But the real palm oil boom correlates with the birth of money politics.
  </p>
  <p>
    A growing body of evidence suggests this is more than just a correlation. Hambit Bintih was far from alone in exploiting his control of land, either for personal gain or to bankroll an election. The first story in this series detailed how this occurred at the beginning of the boom, in a nearby district in Central Kalimantan. Bupatis continue to fall prey to the KPK for accepting bribes for issuing licenses. Other bupatis have been jailed for unrelated graft, after overseeing plantation projects that exhibit many of the hallmarks of a corrupt licensing scheme.
  <p>
    In the years since the genesis of the palm oil boom and money politics, plantation firms have amassed a vast area of land. By 2016, licenses had been issued covering 21 million hectares, an area the size of Kansas. While considerable attention, both within Indonesia and internationally, has been focused on the social and environmental impacts caused by these firms, the role of corruption in driving these crises remains poorly understood. The overlapping interests of palm oil firms and politicians is perhaps the missing piece of the puzzle, one that might explain how the industry consistently wins out over Indonesia’s rural citizens — and provide a cautionary tale for new frontiers, both within the archipelago and in other countries, where the industry is just beginning to expand.

    In June this year, 115 districts, 39 towns and 17 provinces across Indonesia will elect new leaders. The risks that dark money will subvert democracy yet again are well established. The national police chief, Tito Karnavian, has announced plans to form a joint task force with the KPK to coordinate their response. Laode Syarif, deputy commissioner of the KPK, declared the agency would monitor every stage of the contests, from the selection of candidates to the vote and, finally, dispute resolution – where Hambit came unstuck.

    In 2016, in an attempt to stem the excesses of the firms operating in Indonesia’s forests, President Joko Widodo announced a freeze on new oil palm and coal licenses, a measure that will finally take force in the form of a Presidential Instruction [this month]. The Instruction will also mandate a review of existing licenses. Around half of the area covered by licenses remains yet to be exploited, leaving millions of hectares of rainforest and indigenous land still to play for.
  </p>
  <p>
    A meaningful review would delve into how companies and bupatis colluded to game the licensing system, channelling land to the private sector and entrenching the power of corrupt politicians. That in turn could provide lessons that will end the rush of dark money into elections in the future, whether from palm oil, mining, or something else. But it may also be superficial, leaving the firms that amassed billions of dollars of assets in opaque circumstances still untouched, and the KPK straining under the weight of money politics.
  <p>
    Gunung Mas is among the districts that will elect a new bupati this year. Hambit Bintih died of cancer in August 2016, while still serving his prison sentence. His erstwhile rival, Jaya, will stand again. Hambit’s fixer speculated that Jaya would have lost a fortune in 2013, and risks ruin if he fails to win this time round. His competitors will include Rony Karlos, Hambit’s son-in-law, who will take up the mantle for the family.
  </p>
  <p>
    Cornelis was released from prison in 2016. He returned to his Palangkaraya mansion and was welcomed back into the fold at the companies he co-owns with Elan, Edwin and CBIP. Cornelis soured on Hambit and his family after the 2013 scandal. This year he will reputedly back Jaya.
  </p>
  <p>
    In a broad, dim office on the first floor of his official building on the outskirts of Kuala Kurun, Arton, the current bupati, told us he was optimistic about the future of Gunung Mas. Weary from his two terms at the top of government in the district, one as deputy to Hambit, he was not running for office again. But he said every candidate would “have the same dream” to develop Gunung Mas.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then he paused and added, “as long as they’re not corrupt”.
